## Why do we insist on maintaining this repository

Many friends asked me, why do I maintain this repository? Why insist on precise recipes? How will this warehouse develop in the future? Have you ever wanted to monetize traffic? I'd like to give my (@Anduin2017) own answer here, and make clear the values ​​of the contribution.

We have strong infrastructure construction capabilities. For example: we have fitness apps, bracelets, medical platforms, grocery shopping platforms, takeaway platforms, smart refrigerators, smart scales, smart treadmills, etc... But I always need to spend a lot of energy Maneuver and calculate between them. These infrastructures are particularly poor at communicating with each other.

I once imagined that in the future world, human beings no longer need to care about firewood, rice, oil and salt, and the problem of what to eat will be completely solved. Our day-to-day behavior can be best dictated entirely by computers.

Example: The doctor advised me to lose 15 pounds in 50 days. Then these applications receive the conclusion of the medical platform and will be linked. Design a fitness plan for me, automatically calculate the meals I should eat, automatically order the things that are missing in the refrigerator, automatically avoid expiration, automatically calculate the recommended meals, automatically calculate the calorie intake and consumption for me, and automatically ensure that I eat The ones are varied enough to taste good and meet my health requirements, and automatically correct according to the results of my scale measurements, etc.

This is an ideal life management system. It takes a lot of infrastructure integration, so that people really don’t need to worry about these things, just focus on their favorite things. As for what to eat every day, what time to eat, how much to eat, how to eat well, how to be healthy, how to complete my fitness requirements, how to meet the doctor's recommendations, etc... It's all up to the computer to help people do everything well.

Perhaps, building such a system of life and health is extremely costly and difficult to make a profit. We're still focused on solving the problem: going to the hospital after an illness, and none of the programs really helped me manage my health.

Of course, there are still ideals. I hope that one day computers can help humans eliminate diseases. At that time, I hope that my warehouse can be a reliable and powerful screw in this whole complex life system, faithfully undertake its original mission:

> Provide a recipe that is accurate enough.

For additional additional function development, visualization, intelligence, platform docking, food industry, etc., the recipes in this warehouse can be cited for secondary development.

## Warehouse Principles

The development principle of the warehouse: maintain its precise characteristics, and ensure the reading as much as possible while unifying the format to facilitate secondary development.

### weak protocol

I hope that commercial companies, restaurants, enterprises or scientific research institutions can cite this repository. So it will always stick to a weaker license agreement. It will be used as an infrastructure to be used in more and more complex products and scenarios in the future.

Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell or distribute in the form of recipes or dishes, whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes, and by any means.

### Be as formal as possible

Be as formal as possible, including unifying the recipe file format, avoiding inaccurate (especially incomprehensible) units and operations, maintaining a clear directory structure, etc.

Many contributors complained that it was too difficult to check in recipes, and the requirements were too cumbersome. But in fact this recipe is not more for humans to read, but more likely to be processed by machines.

We have to make sure that different people can get almost the same results by following the same recipe.

### Non-Commercial

HowToCook will never insert ads, avoid coupling ingredients in recipes to specific brands as much as possible, and use readily available ingredients wherever possible.

HowToCook will never discuss monetization. And will always be maintained by the community driven.
